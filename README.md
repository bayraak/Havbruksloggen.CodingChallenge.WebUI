## Havbruksloggen.CodingChallenge.WebUI 📝
I cloned and ran every single Havbruksloggen.CodingChallenge.WebUI listed to have redux-starter-kit as a dependancy on GitHub. The ones that ran wern't up to date with new react hooks and redux syntax or didn't implement Typescript of persisted state.

- create-react-app
- typescript
- redux-starter-kit
- persisted store with local storage
- arrow functions
- hooks
- react-bootstrap
